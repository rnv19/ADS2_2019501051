Project Report - Seam Carving

Problem Statement: 
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. 
A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row; 
a horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column. 
the path with the least sum of energy is considered as the seam to remove.

Steps to do:
Step 1) Calculate energies of pixels of given image
Step 2) Calculate cumulative energies of pixels of energies from step 1
Step 3) Find Vertical seam and Horizontal seam using cumulative energy matrix from step 2
Step 4) Remove the vertical seam and horizontal seam and resize the image

Related Concepts:
•	2D arrays
•	matrix transpose 
•	Formulae for Calculating energies
•	Topological sort 
•	Programming Language – Java
•	Picture API

Code:

public class SeamCarver {

    //time complexity: O(W * H)
    //space complexity: O(W * H)
    public SeamCarver(Picture picture){
    }

    //time complexity: O(W * H)
    //space complexity: O(W * H)
    public Picture picture(){
    }

    //time complexity: O(1)
    //space complexity: O(1)
    public int width(){
    }

    //time complexity: O(1)
    //space complexity: O(1)
    public int height(){
    }

    //time complexity: O(1)
    //space complexity: O(1)
    public double energy(int x, int y){
    }

    //time complexity: O(3*W * H)
    //space complexity: O(2*W * H)
    public int[] findVerticalSeam(){
    }

    //time complexity: O(3*W * H)
    //space complexity: O(3*W * H)
    public int[] findHorizontalSeam(){
    }


    //time complexity: O(3*W * H)
    //space complexity: O(2*W * H)
    public void removeHorizontalSeam(int[] seam){
    }

    //time complexity: O(3*W * H)
    //space complexity: O(2*W * H)
    public void removeVerticalSeam(int[] seam){
    }

}

Difficulties Faced:
•	confusion iterating through rows and column
•	Removing the seam implementation is different for Horizontal and Vertical

Testcases:
1.	Remove the horizontal seam
2.	Energy imposing

Score: 88/100
